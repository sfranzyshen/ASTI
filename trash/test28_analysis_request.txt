Question: Are these failures primarily caused by:
1. Field ordering issues (cosmetic JSON field arrangement)
2. Loop termination sequence differences (functional execution behavior)
3. Precision calculation differences (mathematical computation)

Which issues are FUNCTIONAL vs COSMETIC? Which would be safe to fix via normalization vs requiring code changes?
